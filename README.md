It is widely acknowledged that the position of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the moment of a person's birth is of particular importance to their life. Tools exist to determine a person's Sun sign and Moon sign and the constellations containing most of the planets. But what about the most important planet of all?

Which constellation was the planet Earth in when you were born?

Package earthsign identifies the constellation directly below a point on Earth's surface at a particular moment; that is, the constellation that (the center of) Earth is "in" from the perspective of a local observer. Surely this information has a special deep significance and meaning that exclusively applies to someone born in that location at that time.

Command earthsign provides equivalent functionality from the command line.
